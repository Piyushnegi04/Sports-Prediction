# ******IPL Score Prediction using Machine Learning******	

## Overview

This project aims to predict the scores of IPL matches using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the likely score of a team based on historical match data.

## Features

Data Collection: Historical IPL match data, including scores, venues, teams, and other relevant statistics.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature selection, and normalization.

Modeling: Implementing various machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and others to predict scores.

Evaluation: Comparing the performance of different models using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R-squared.

Deployment: The best-performing model is deployed as a web application where users can input match details and get score predictions.

## **Model Performance**

Linear Regression

Random Forest

Decision Tree

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical IPL match data.
The data includes features like team names, venues, toss results, and previous match performances.

## Future Enhancements

Incorporate More Features: Include additional features such as player statistics, weather conditions, etc.

Advanced Modeling: Experiment with deep learning models and ensemble techniques.

Real-time Predictions: Integrate live data feeds for real-time score predictions during ongoing matches
